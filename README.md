Lesser known strategies to apply in 2025

Alright â€” youâ€™re asking for **100 lesser-known business strategies** â€” meaning not the common advice like "focus on customers" or "be innovative," but real, **underused or under-publicized** tactics.

I'll divide these into categories like: Product, Marketing, Sales, Brand, Hiring, Finance, Growth, etc., so itâ€™s better organized.

Hereâ€™s a big list to get started:

---

### PRODUCT STRATEGIES
1. **Make a Decoy Product** to drive people toward a more profitable option.
2. **Release "Ugly" Versions First** to create customer attachment before launching a polished upgrade.
3. **Create "Exit Barriers"** by making your product a platform (e.g., integrations, plugins).
4. **Sell "Consumption Tools"** â€” tools that help customers use your main product more (e.g., Appleâ€™s chargers).
5. **Design "Negative Cost Products"** that generate recurring revenue after the sale (e.g., printers and ink).
6. **Use Scarcity Windows** where the product is only available on limited dates.
7. **Modularize Product** to sell add-ons or enhancements later.
8. **Create a Paid Certification** around your product use.
9. **Offer Paid Beta Access** instead of free betas to validate serious demand.
10. **Create "Micro Versions"** â€” highly focused versions for niche markets.

### MARKETING STRATEGIES
11. **Reverse Testimonials** â€” publish what objections customers had before buying.
12. **Marketing via Silent Ambassadors** (gifting products to silent influencers, not stars).
13. **Launch a "Whatâ€™s Broken?" Campaign** (invite customers to send product ideas, then make them public heroes).

15. **Hijack Small Trends** before they go mainstream (microtrends).
16. **Partner with Boring Businesses** that have trust but no marketing (e.g., local insurance agents).
17. **Newsletter Arbitrage** â€” buy small newsletters cheap to capture audiences.
