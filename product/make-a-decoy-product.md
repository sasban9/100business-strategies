## Strategy: Make a Decoy Product to Drive People Toward a More Profitable Option

One of the most subtle — but incredibly powerful — business strategies is **the Decoy Effect**.  
It’s about **intentionally designing an option that is less attractive**, not to sell it, but to **make another product look like a much better deal**.

Used correctly, it can dramatically **boost your sales and profits** by **guiding customers’ decisions without them feeling pressured**.

### How the Decoy Effect Works

Humans don't make purchasing decisions in a vacuum.  
We often decide what’s "good" or "bad" based on **comparisons** — especially when we're faced with options that seem similar.

If you **introduce a third option** that is:

- **Clearly inferior** to one of the options,
- **Priced awkwardly** or **offers worse value**,  
it **nudges** customers to choose the more attractive (and often more profitable) option without second-guessing.

**The decoy isn’t meant to sell — it’s meant to make your real target look irresistible.**

### Real-World Examples

**1. The Popcorn Example (Famous Case Study):**  
At a movie theater:

| Size       | Price      |
|------------|------------|
| Small      | $3         |
| Medium     | $7         |
| Large      | $8         |

Initially, customers think:  
- "Small is cheap, but too small."  
- "Large is too expensive."  
So they might just buy a Small.

Now, the theater **adds a "decoy" Medium** that's badly priced — almost as expensive as Large but not much better than Small.

Result?  
Most people think,  
> "For just $1 more, I get a Large. That's a great deal!"

**Large popcorn sales soar.**

**The decoy (Medium)** wasn’t designed to sell — it was designed to make the **Large** look like an amazing value.

**2. Software Pricing Tiers Example:**  
Imagine a SaaS company offering:

| Plan         | Features                  | Price |
|--------------|----------------------------|-------|
| Basic        | 5 features                  | $29   |
| Standard     | 10 features                 | $79   |
| Premium      | 11 features (only 1 extra)  | $99   |

Without a "decoy," people may hesitate between Basic and Premium.

But now the company adds:

| Plan         | Features                  | Price |
|--------------|----------------------------|-------|
| Basic        | 5 features                  | $29   |
| Standard     | 8 features (only 3 more)    | $69   |
| Premium      | 11 features (full package)  | $99   |

Now Standard looks "weak" next to Premium, making Premium seem worth the extra $30.

Result:  
Customers jump to **Premium** — the company's most profitable plan.

### Why This Strategy Works Psychologically

- **Anchoring Bias:**  
  People compare prices relative to other options rather than evaluating them in isolation.
  
- **Perceived Value:**  
  The more unfair the comparison looks (decoy vs. target), the more "obvious" the better deal feels.

- **Decision Simplicity:**  
  Adding a decoy reduces choice paralysis by subtly pointing toward the "best" option.

**Customers feel they made a smart decision — not that they were manipulated.**

---

### How to Create a Good Decoy

**1. Make the Decoy Close in Price, but Inferior in Value:**  
- It should cost almost as much as your "target" option.
- It should offer significantly less for the price.

**2. Clearly Differentiate Value:**  
- Highlight what they *miss out on* if they pick the decoy instead of the better option.

**3. Keep It Simple:**  
- Too many choices will confuse and paralyze customers.
- Ideally, you want 3 choices — one decoy, one target, and one basic.

**4. Use Visuals if Possible:**  
- On websites, use comparison tables, highlight "Best Value" labels, or visually nudge attention toward the profitable option.

### Mini-Challenge for You

Think about your current product lineup or service packages.  
Ask:

- Can you create a "middle" or "awkward" option?
- How can you use a decoy to push buyers toward your higher-margin offer?
- What features, bonuses, or small price tweaks could you use to make the profitable choice obvious?

Even if you don't currently have tiers, **you can bundle your product or service differently** to introduce this effect.

### Final Thought

**Selling more isn't always about improving the product — sometimes, it's about improving the *choice architecture* around it.**  
By adding a decoy, you gently steer customers toward the decisions that grow your business faster — **without pressure, tricks, or hard selling**.

Done right, it’s one of the most elegant, ethical, and effective pricing strategies you can use.
