## Design "Negative Cost Products" That Generate Recurring Revenue After the Sale (e.g., Printers and Ink)

One of the smartest — yet often hidden — business models in the world is selling **“negative cost products.”**  
At first, this sounds strange:  
> **You sell a product at a low price (or even a loss), but you make big profits later by selling what the customer needs to keep using it.**

This model flips traditional thinking.  
Instead of trying to make maximum profit on the first sale, you design the **real profits to come afterward** — continuously, predictably, and at high margins.

### Why This Strategy Works

**1. Low Friction for New Customers:**  
Lower-priced products make it easier for customers to buy without overthinking.  
A $50 printer seems like a no-brainer — until the customer realizes they’ll spend hundreds on ink over its lifetime.

**2. Predictable Recurring Revenue:**  
Once customers are using the product, they need to keep buying supplies, parts, or refills — providing you with stable, long-term income.

**3. High Switching Costs:**  
Customers often feel “locked in” because replacing the product means wasting their original investment.  
They prefer to keep buying your consumables rather than switching brands.

**4. Opportunities for Subscription Models:**  
You can automate future purchases through monthly subscription services — making your revenue even more predictable.

### Famous Real-World Examples

**1. Printers and Ink (HP, Epson, Canon):**  
Printers are often sold at break-even prices — or even at a slight loss.  
But printer ink cartridges are expensive, tiny, and must be replaced often.  
**The ink is where the real money is made.**

**2. Razors and Blades (Gillette, Dollar Shave Club):**  
Razors are cheap (sometimes even free in promotions).  
But razor blade refills are costly — and needed frequently.

**3. Game Consoles and Games (Sony PlayStation, Xbox):**  
Sony often sells PlayStation consoles at low margins, especially early in a console’s life cycle.  
They make profits from:
- Game sales
- Online subscriptions (PS Plus, Xbox Live)
- Digital downloads
- In-game purchases

**4. Coffee Machines and Pods (Keurig, Nespresso):**  
Keurig machines are affordable, but the real money comes from selling **coffee pods** — a small, recurring, everyday expense.

**5. Electric Toothbrushes and Brush Heads (Oral-B, Sonicare):**  
Electric toothbrushes are priced accessibly.  
Replacement brush heads (which must be changed every 3 months) are where the brand earns steady profits.

### How to Build a "Negative Cost Product" System

**1. Identify a Repeating Need:**  
What do customers need regularly to keep using your main product?  
- Refills  
- Replacements  
- Add-ons  
- Consumables  
- Accessories

**2. Price the Main Product Attractively:**  
Make the initial buy-in low enough that it feels easy and appealing.  
You want a "low mental barrier" for first-time customers.

**3. Design for Dependency:**  
Ensure the product *requires* your refills or extras —  
and ideally, make alternatives from competitors harder or less attractive to use.

**4. Build Quality Into the Ecosystem, Not Just the Product:**  
Even if the original product is affordable, the customer's ongoing experience should feel **high quality**.  
This justifies the recurring spend.

**5. Offer Subscriptions and Auto-Refill Options:**  
Modern customers love convenience.  
Create subscriptions:
- Ink delivery every 3 months
- Razor blades mailed monthly
- Coffee pods replenished automatically  
This locks in predictable revenue and reduces churn.

### Potential Industries for "Negative Cost" Models

- **Healthcare:** Cheap diagnostic devices that require regular test strips or sensors.
- **Fitness:** Affordable fitness trackers with paid app upgrades, meal plans, or virtual coaching.
- **Education:** Free/cheap e-learning apps that require paid certificates, premium resources, or extra tutoring.
- **Beauty:** Low-cost beauty devices with expensive refill cartridges (e.g., skincare, hair removal).
- **Pet Care:** Smart pet feeders sold affordably, with expensive food subscription plans.

### Mini-Challenge for You

Think about your product or service:

- **Can you lower the upfront cost to make adoption easier?**
- **What ongoing purchases could your customers naturally need afterward?**
- **Could you offer a subscription or auto-renew model to make it frictionless?**

You don’t need to sacrifice quality or trick customers.  
Done right, **both you and your customers win**:  
They enjoy a smooth, reliable experience, and you earn continuous, growing profits.

### Final Thought

**Selling once is hard. Selling continuously is smart.**  
By designing negative cost products, you don’t just make a sale —  
you create an **economic relationship** that can last months, years, or even decades.

In the long game of business,  
**the winners aren't those who sell the most products —  
but those who create revenue streams that never stop flowing.**
