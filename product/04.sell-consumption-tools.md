## Strategy: Sell "Consumption Tools" — Tools That Help Customers Use Your Main Product More (e.g., Apple’s Chargers)

When businesses think about increasing sales, they often focus only on selling more of their **main product**.  
But the smartest brands do something different:  
> **They sell "consumption tools" — additional products that make using the main product easier, faster, or more enjoyable.**

By doing this, they don't just earn extra revenue;  
they also **deepen customer dependence** on the core product,  
**increase switching costs**,  
and **open new streams of profit** without needing new customers.

### Why Selling Consumption Tools Works

**1. Enhances the Customer Experience:**  
When a tool makes using your main product smoother, faster, or better, it **increases customer satisfaction** and **reduces friction**.

**2. Creates Multiple Revenue Streams:**  
Every consumption tool sold brings **extra income** without needing to find new users.

**3. Deepens Ecosystem Lock-in:**  
When a customer buys tools designed specifically for your product,  
it becomes harder for them to switch to competitors later.

**4. Encourages Higher Product Usage:**  
The more easily customers can use your product, the more they will use it —  
leading to **greater attachment, greater lifetime value**, and **more word-of-mouth promotion**.

### Real-World Examples

**1. Apple:**  
Apple doesn't just sell iPhones.  
They sell:
- Chargers
- AirPods
- Protective cases
- Cables
- Adapters
- Stands  
All designed specifically for Apple devices.

Many of these are simple, relatively low-cost products — but together, they create **billions of dollars in extra revenue** and make it more attractive for users to stay inside the Apple ecosystem.

**2. Coffee Machines:**  
Companies like Keurig and Nespresso sell coffee machines at very affordable rates.  
But their real profits come from selling **coffee pods** — the consumption tool you need to actually use the machine regularly.

**3. GoPro:**  
GoPro cameras are great — but their ecosystem of:
- Mounts
- Tripods
- Cases
- Waterproof housings
- External microphones  
makes it easier for customers to use GoPro cameras in all kinds of environments — while massively boosting GoPro’s profits.

**4. Canva:**  
Canva started as a free graphic design platform.  
Now they sell consumption tools like:
- Premium templates
- Pro elements
- Stock photos
- Fonts  
These extras help users design faster and better — while providing Canva recurring revenue.

### How to Sell Consumption Tools Effectively

**1. Identify What Makes Your Product Easier or More Enjoyable to Use:**  
Ask:  
- What accessories, tools, or extras make it easier to start, use, or upgrade?
- Where are users struggling or getting stuck?

**2. Bundle Smartly:**  
Offer bundles that include the main product and consumption tools together.  
(E.g., a phone + charger + case starter pack.)

**3. Price Strategically:**  
Consumption tools are often high-margin products.  
However, the perceived value should be obvious.  
Customers should feel they are buying something *useful* — not being "nickeled and dimed."

**4. Make the Tools Essential for Regular Use:**  
If possible, design your product so that customers naturally need to rebuy or upgrade the tool regularly.  
(E.g., ink for printers, pods for coffee machines.)

**5. Brand the Tools as Premium Experiences:**  
Position consumption tools as ways to "unlock the full potential" of the main product.  
This creates emotional desire, not just practical need.

### Potential Types of Consumption Tools

- **Accessories:** Physical extras like chargers, covers, batteries, stands, and cases.
- **Digital Add-ons:** Software plugins, templates, premium content libraries.
- **Consumables:** Items that are used up (coffee pods, printer ink, razor blades).
- **Service Extensions:** Training, consulting, setup services that make using the product smoother.
- **Upgrades:** Paid enhancements that make the original product more powerful.

### Mini-Challenge for You

Look at your own product or service:

- What small, helpful add-ons could you sell to make the customer experience smoother or richer?
- Could you offer bundles, starter kits, or premium accessory packs?

Even if you don't have physical products, you can create **digital consumption tools** like templates, extensions, or paid guides.

### Final Thought

**Selling a great product is just the beginning.**  
The real magic happens when you create an entire experience around it.

By offering smart, useful consumption tools,  
you **multiply your revenue**, **increase customer loyalty**, and **build an unbeatable ecosystem** around your brand.

In a competitive world, the businesses that win are not the ones who sell the most products —  
but the ones who **become indispensable to their customers' daily lives**.
