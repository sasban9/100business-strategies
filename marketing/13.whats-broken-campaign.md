## **Launch a "What’s Broken?" Campaign (Invite Customers to Send Product Ideas, Then Make Them Public Heroes)**

---

### Concept Overview:
Instead of *guessing* what to improve or build next, **directly invite customers to tell you** — not in a boring survey, but through an *exciting public challenge*.  
Ask:  
- **“What’s broken?”**  
- **“What frustrates you?”**  
- **“What would you fix or create?”**

Then, **celebrate the contributors** — making them *public heroes* by recognizing and rewarding their ideas.

It’s not just about getting feedback.  
It’s about creating a **movement**:  
"**We build products together.**"

---

### Why It Works:
- **Customers Feel Ownership:**  
  When people help shape something, they feel emotionally invested in its success.
  
- **Fresh Product Ideas:**  
  You get real-world insights that R&D teams often miss — actual user pain points, hacks, and innovations.

- **Public Relations Gold:**  
  Announcing "our next feature was suggested by a customer" wins huge goodwill and positive media attention.

- **Strengthens Loyalty:**  
  Customers who contribute — even small ideas — stay longer, advocate harder, and forgive mistakes more easily.

- **Saves Time and Money:**  
  Instead of endless market research, your community crowdsources your next winning moves.

### How to Design a "What’s Broken?" Campaign:

**1. Create an Emotional Invitation:**  
Don’t just say "Submit ideas."  
Frame it as a rebellion or a positive uprising:
- "Tell us what’s broken — and we’ll fix it together!"
- "The best products are made by the people who use them."

**2. Make It Easy to Participate:**  
- One-click submissions.  
- Use polls, email, social media hashtags, or simple Google Forms.
- Allow voice/video submissions if possible (for authenticity).

**3. Keep the Scope Clear:**  
- Focus submissions around specific areas: e.g., "shipping experience," "setup process," "missing features," etc.
- Otherwise, people may send wild unrelated ideas.

**4. Reward Involvement, Not Just Winners:**  
- Highlight best submissions publicly.  
- Offer swag, gift cards, early product access, or public shoutouts.
- Even a simple "Certificate of Contribution" can be powerful!

**5. Feature the Heroes Loudly:**  
- Write blog posts about contributors.
- Include their names (or photos if permitted) in product release notes.
- Create a "Wall of Heroes" on your website.
- Consider titles like “Chief Fixer,” “Innovation Partner,” or “First Builder.”

### How to Turn Ideas into Public Moments:
- **Idea to Prototype Series:**  
  Document (through blogs, short videos, or tweets) how customer suggestions turn into real products.

- **Name Features After Them:**  
  E.g., "The Alex Martin Fix" (if Alex suggested it).

- **Community Voting:**  
  Let the broader community vote on top suggestions — adds transparency and buzz.

### Examples of Brands Doing Similar Things:
- **LEGO Ideas:**  
  Fans submit new kit ideas. Winning ideas become real LEGO sets, and creators get royalties and fame.

- **Starbucks “My Starbucks Idea”:**  
  Customers suggested hundreds of product improvements, new flavors, and store upgrades — many of which got implemented.

- **Duolingo Feedback Loops:**  
  The language app heavily listens to frustrated users to update curriculum, UI, and features, sometimes crediting vocal users.

### Pitfalls to Watch Out For:
- **Ignoring Contributions:**  
  If you ask but never act or acknowledge, it feels worse than not asking at all. Be prepared to publicly respond to suggestions.

- **Scope Creep:**  
  Wild ideas outside your brand’s mission can flood your team. Stay clear in your call-to-action focus.

- **Being Slow to Deliver:**  
  If customers suggest something, and you take 2 years to build it, the magic dies. Celebrate small wins fast.

---

### Bonus Enhancements:
- **Gamify the Submissions:**  
  Create badges like "Problem Spotter," "Innovator," "First Responder" for participants.

- **Invite Collaboration:**  
  Sometimes different customers suggest *similar* improvements — invite them to collaborate or co-name features.

- **Run Recurring Campaigns:**  
  Make "What’s Broken?" an annual or quarterly event so people look forward to fixing and innovating alongside you.

### Ultimate Outcome:
Customers don’t just *buy* your product anymore.  
They *build it* with you.  
This transforms your brand from "just another company" to a **living, breathing movement** people feel proud to be part of.

It’s emotional loyalty, not transactional loyalty.  
And that’s far more valuable.
